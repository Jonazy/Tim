# Tim
Tim is a wepapp hangout/networking system

Tim - This shall require short purpose of the time together, location, time, number of people on demand.

## Problem

Often time I ended up not planning my weekdays or on a good day i have all my task for the day cleared. Next I want 
to do is to have my boyfriend / girlfriend to spend the rest of my time with. Sometimes this work in my favour that 
those i decide to reach out to are free, then luckily for me i have fun and enjoy my time. But if it goes other way 
that all i reach out to are busy then my mood is ruined, I will feel disappointed and I will end up doing nothing
(Well i can pick up books to read or games to play. But all I want is human to talk to!)
What about weekends? Mostly I have no where to go on weekend, i all it my "rest day" and i end up getting bored. At 
this point reaching out to friend mostly ended up as disappointment. When I reach out to friends, they will either say
it impromptu or they are busy or engage with something else. In other not to buzz people and request for time which was 
never planned for, I decide to create a system to accommodate this demand. 

## Solution
First this will be a webapp that will function as a real time networking application across all professions, worldwide.
It will enable it users to request/join other users "Tim"(Short time event) in an agreed location. User of the app will
be able to create "Tim". This will be publish to all other user close to location of the "Tim".
Interest user shall signify interest by joining, then user are prompt to agreed to terms and conditions(A reminder agreement)
